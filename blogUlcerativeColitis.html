	<p> We tend to take our health for granted until something goes wrong. In my case, I was diagnosed with Acute Severe
	Ulcerative Colitis in February 2023. Ulcerative Colitis is a miserable digestive disease. I was hospitalized twice, and from January - March 2023, I had lost so much weight that I was just skin and bones. Thankfully, during my second hospitalization at the end of March 2023, I received an infusion of Remicade. This medicine worked miraculously on me. Within hours I felt like a dark cloud that had been keeping me down, had just floated away. I was able to recover in just a couple of months. By July 2023, my colon looked almost normal. During my recovery, I also implemented a healthy gut routine. The tables below show my healthy gut routine, which has kept me free from any flares since my first infusion of Remicade. This information might be helpful to someone else who is suffering from Ulcerative Colitis, or anyone who is interested in improving his or her gut health.
    </p>
	<p>
        UPDATE JAN/FEB/MARCH 2024: My fecal calprotectin level is elevated, and I have symptoms of a mild flare. I strayed from my normal routine during the Christmas and New Years Holidays, and now I'm paying for it. In addition, my recent infusion of Inflectra in early February had no effect at reducing my symptoms. Perhaps the Inflectra contained the flare to just the end of my colon, but that's unclear. Nevertheless, I have hope! I am receiving 12 hyperbaric oxygen treatments during the month of March. I will provide an update soon!
	</p>
	<p>
        UPDATE JAN 2025: The hyperbaric oxygen treatments reduced my symptoms, but not enough to get me out of my flare. Once I took prednisone, the flare went away. However, the hyperbaric oxygen treatments were not a failure. The treatments just weren't strong enough as a sole treatment. I mentioned to my gastroenterologist that I would eventually like to discontinue Inflectra infusions. (Inflectra is a powerful medicine, and there is an increased risk of cancer with long term use.) I suggested that I would like to use mesalamine enemas and hyperbaric oxygen treatments as a maintainence therapy. This would discourage the return of ulcerative colitis flares by working both locally with the enemas, and systemically with the hyperbaric oxygen. My doctor isn't opposed to this plan! So perhaps I'll try this in 2026, or earlier. I've been free from a flare since April 2024, and I'm still receiving Inflectra infusions. (Although I flared in early 2024, I didn't develop antibodies to the Inflectra. So I'm still receiving the infusions.) I'm feeling great!
