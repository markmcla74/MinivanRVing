	<p> I made a website that assists a person in reaching a relaxing, meditative state. Just as a calculator helps you solve math problems, the
	<a href="https://markmcla74.github.io/Meditation-Assistant/">DIY Mind Machine</a> helps you meditate. The DIY Mind Machine is free, and it's very similar to a gadget called <a href="https://braintap.com/membership-and-headset/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=CPC&utm_campaign=Pmax&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22152394459&gclid=CjwKCAjw7fzDBhA7EiwAOqJkh1d68oS98BpfqBqrB4ylzVFzVqKyUy0nR9VwSlVNKdU4cX_SvA8enxoCGGgQAvD_BwE#">BrainTap</a>. Both the DIY Mind Machine and BrainTap use binaural tones and flashing lights to induce a calm, meditative state. This sensation is called brain entrainment. The easiest way to get started with the DIY Mind Machine is to mount your phone on a gooseneck phone holder. Then navigate to the DIY Mind Machine website. The gooseneck phone holder allows you to experience brain entrainment without the distraction of having anything attached to your face. I also designed a custom headset that works well too, and the website will show you how to make one. I hope you try it out. I feel like I'm experiencing an entirely new world when I'm using the DIY Mind Machine. That's why I want to share it with everyone. If you enjoy the DIY Mind Machine, please let me know!
