However, you have to do a little work to properly secure this magnetic phone holder to the dash. You need to pad the holder with thin rubber strips and secure the setup with nuts and screws to the paneling on the dash.

Do you remember long ago when car stereos offered the option to play CDs from a 6 CD changer? Well, the stereo on a second generation Toyota Sienna has a port for a 6 CD changer. The GTA Bluetooth kit simply plugs into this port, and voila, your stereo can play music from your phone via bluetooth!

	The magnetic car mount and GTA Bluetooth kit have really improved my minivan driving experience.
