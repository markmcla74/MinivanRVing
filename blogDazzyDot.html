	<p> Lighting is very important in a minivan camper. I have four lights recessed in the headliner of my minivan using boat inspection hatches. Three of the lights are dimmable, and they provide plenty of light, and they create a pleasant mood in my minivan. However, the fourth light is the

The light operates independently from the other three lights. The puck lights come in a pair of two, so I always have a backup if a puck light runs out of battery power. In addition, the dazzy dot puck light provides two more benefits. 1) The puck light replaced the need for the standard interior lights. So I was able to disable the interior lights in my minivan, and I can repeatedly open and close the doors, or leave the doors open, or do whatever I want without draining the car battery. 2) This opening in the headliner for the dazzy dot puck light, along with the openings in the headliner for the other three lights, allowed me easily to run the wire that connects the camera for my rear view mirror camera to my rear view mirror.
