	<p> For no reason, the abs error light just appeared on my Toyota Sienna. For about a week, the error light would intermittently turn on and off. But finally the light remained permanently on. When I connected a scan tool to my minivan, I received the error code C0256. This indicated that the electronic control module for the abs system had somehow failed. I bought a replacement refurbished module from ebay. Unfortunately, the error remained. It turned out that the refurbished module was also faulty! Six months later, when I had some spare time, I went to the LKQ Pick Your Part Salvage Yard, and I retrieved another module from a junked Sienna that looked almost like my Sienna. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs1AHIWkg-o">link to the youtube video that shows how to replace the module.</a> However, somewhere in the comments there is a link to the vender who sells the refurbished modules on ebay. Be aware that the refurbished module might be defective.
