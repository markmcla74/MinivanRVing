 <h3>Top 5 Minivan Camper Conversions, after mine of course! </h3>
 <section id="mainContent">
     <p>#5 - Divine Zeal, Hammock in a minivan. Hammocks are self leveling and very space efficient. If you were to remove the front passenger seat, then you could have the most spacious minivan conversion of all. I often consider replacing my bed with a hammock. The only problem is that I sleep better in a bed. But maybe someday I'll take the leap and replace my bed with a hammock.   </p>

    <p>#4 Nick and Maela, Minivan Conversion using Wathier Bed. The Wathier Bed is very clever. The bed is wide, which is good. But the bed doesn't provide a lounge mode. And the couch mode uses the entire width of the bed, which wastes space in my opinion. This is still an excellent minivan camper conversion!</p>

    <p>#3 Travels with Rob Minivan Camper. Everything is very thoughtfully organized, with high quality craftsmanship and attention to detail. However, even when features like a permanent sink, shelves and tables are constructed to the highest quality, you still have a trade off in that you will block access to one of the side doors, and you're encroaching on the very limited open space. In a small space like a minivan, you want to open the space as much as possible. This means that you want to avoid blocking doors and windows. This minivan camper conversion is still super nice. There are several minivan camper conversions that are similar to this still overall excellent design, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJjL-NWeoVI"> Eric Enjoys Earth</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO2-2EKtJLc">Bruce Parks</a>.</p>

	<p>#2 Journey Vision Minivan Camper. This is an awesome minivan camper conversion. This conversion had the boldness to make permanent changes to the minivan. It's spacious, efficiently organized, and pretty close to perfect. I think a wider bed might be nicer, but it might be worth having the smaller bed as a trade off for such a nice space. I'm not sure... </p>

	<p>#1 Alan Twigg, Lage Futon Mattress in a Minivan Camper. I completely agree with Alan Twigg's philosophy that you need a big comfortable bed. This is the most important feature of any minivan camper conversion. (Unless you can train yourself to sleep in a hammock...) I also like the open space and lack of clutter. And he has a cargo box to store all of his extra stuff. Well done! </p>
