	<p> The bed is the most important item in a minivan camper. This bed has all of the important features that I wanted. These features are listed below. And several pictures of the bed are shown after this list.
        <ul>
            <li> The 22" wide wedge pillow allows for the bed to have a couch mode and lounge mode. It's also nice that the couch mode and lounge mode don't use the entire width of the bed, since I don't need to use the entire width of the bed in these modes. Also, the extra space allows me to store random stuff on the bed during the day. </li> <br>
            <li> This bed provides nearly maximum storage in the tub area at the back of the minivan. I built the bedframe by modifying an REI Kingdom Cot 3. To widen this cot, I cut the cot in half. I also removed some pieces, and I cut others pieces, and I moved some other pieces around. Then I used 4' wide unistrut sections to attach the left and right halves of the modified cot back together. I also heated a piece of pvc pipe and I squished the pipe into the unattached pieces at the end of the bed frame.</li> <br>
            <li> The panels that fit on top of the bed frame are lightweight and the panels can be moved while I'm inside the minivan. These lightweight panels let me access the tub area at the back of the minivan even when I'm inside the minivan. The panels are contructed from 1" pink insulated foam. In addition, I glued window screens to the top and bottom of the foam panels to provide strength to the foam panels. There are several youtube videos that describe this construction process. </li> <br>
            <li> The extension for the bed is made from a milk crate, three boards, and those cushions that "thicken" the wedge pillow when the bed is in couch mode. The "cushions" are pieces from the original mattress that I cut with a hacksaw blade. And then I inserted extra wide pillow cases around each piece of foam mattress that I cut. The milk crate was trimmed a couple of inches to lower its height, and it serves a dual purpose of also storing items. Two of the boards are long, and they span between the milk crate and the third board that acts as a support. The cushions are easily placed on top of the long boards. And when the bed extension is set up, the wedge pillow is stored out of the way, on top of the drivers seat. And voila, the bed is extended. To remove the bed extension, the two long boards are stored nicely under the bed, between the unistrut supports. The third support board sits on top of the milk crate. It's true that it might take 30 seconds longer to set up this extension compared to other beds. BUT, my bed is still pretty easy to set up. </li> <br>
            <li> The mattress is a 5" memory foam mattress. This mattress is very comfortable, and it's thick enough that I don't feel the foam panels that support the mattress. And yet the mattress is "bendy" enough that I can easily bend it to access the tub area at the back of my minivan. </li> <br>
            <li> The bed uses the entire 48" width of the minivan. This width provides me with enough space so that I can kick, and roll, and spread out like I'm laying in a real bed! And the holes in the side of my minivan, along with the hole in the roof, provide a path for fresh air all night. AND I can breathe fresh air while all of the windows are covered! </li> <br>
            <li> I can store the window covers under the bed, along with my clothes. </li> <br>
            <li> The bed frame is very light, and it can be easily removed from my minivan. </li> <br>
            <li> I was able to construct the bed with simple tools. And yet, I have better features, and even more features, than beds that were constucted using advanced techniques. </li> <br>
            <li> I hope my bed provides you with lots of ideas for your own minivan camper bed! Enjoy the pictures that are shown below. </li> <br>
